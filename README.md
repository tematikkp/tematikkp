Hello there. Welcome to my user page.

I'm Tematikkp (stylized in all lowercase), also known as THETM in other platforms. I play osu! a lot, and I'm currently a 6 digit player.

# History
## As a Scratcher
On January 28, 2022, I joined Scratch, and at the same day, I created [my first ever Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/635559675/). 6 days later, I shared my first Scratch project. On February 19, 2022, I shared my second project and became a Scratcher.  In May 2022, I started to become less active than usual.

## The Day I Discovered osu!
In around late June 2022, I discovered a rhythm game called osu! in Scratch, made by SpiritSK. On July 12, 2022, I joined osu! for real.
