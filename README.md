Hello there. Welcome to my user page.

I'm Tematikkp (stylized in all lowercase), also known as Thetm in other platforms. I am just your ordinary coder.

# History
## As a Scratcher
On January 28, 2022, I joined Scratch, and at the same day, I created [my first ever Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/635559675/). 6 days later, I shared my first Scratch project. On February 19, 2022, I shared my second project and became a Scratcher.  In May 2022, I started to become less active than usual. In July 2022, I started to become more and more inactive in that platform.

In 2024, [I announced that I'll no longer accept random studio invites](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/tematikkp#comments-317229551) except if it's advertised from someone I know. Since I'm inactive, only minor projects will be made, though rarely.

## The Day I Discovered osu!
In around 2020, I discovered a rhythm game called osu! when I was strolling around on YouTube. I looked at ItsPforPea's channel and their old videos from years ago before Plants vs. Zombies.

In around late June 2022, I discovered this remake on Scratch, made by SpiritSK. On July 12, 2022, I joined osu! for real. On April 12, 2024, I finally got to 5 digit in the game.
